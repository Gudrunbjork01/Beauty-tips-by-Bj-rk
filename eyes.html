            <p> The eyes are the window of the soul they say, and the key to a great 
                eye is the base. It might not sound important but trust us you do not want 
                a greasy eye with cakey eyeshadow at the end of your night, but why
                prime your eyes? well first and foremost for keeping all that oil away 
                from your art of an eyeshadow and preventing it from smudging trough
                all that heat or not so warm weather. So ig you have not already splurged on
                a good eye primer, do so.

        <p> eyeshadow? how hard can it be. Well it might seem easy but there is actually 
            alot of research behind eyeshadow and why it makes you look attractive.
            Its not only used to enhance your beauty but you´r eye color aswell. For example
            warm colors like orange and yellow compliment blue eyes, greenish colors make brown
            eyes pop and pinkish end red colors love green eyes. eyeshadow is a form of 
            art, you could go all in with bold colors and design or take the natural 
            route, it is all up to you.
