        <h2> Who are we </h2>
        <h5> Makeup is art </h5>
        <p> We at Beauty tips by Björk strive
            to help others feel confident about themselves with or without makeup.
            The beauty industry is a passion of ours and we want to share our knowledge
            with you. the makeup industry has been around for hundreds of years and trough
            the years it just continues to grow, it can be hard some days to keep up with
            new trends and techniques. Makeup does not have to be the traditional everyday makeup,
            <bold> makeup is art </bold> and is meant to be bold and. played with. and
            is meant to be used in any forms by any gender, age, religion.
        </p>
