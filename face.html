        We all know it can be hard to find you´r right foundation, concealer or bronzer 
        shade, it can be a struggle. Wether you are dark, white, red yellow an so on.
        There are however ways to help this problem. The firsta thing you can do is 
        find out you´r undertone. if you dont know you can look at you´r veins on
        the arm.if they are blue or purple you have ha cool skintone, if they are 
        greenish or purple. you have a warm undertone.
